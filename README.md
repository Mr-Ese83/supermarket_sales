- Invoice ID
- Branch
- City
- Customer type
- Gender
- Product line
- Unit price
- Quantity
- Total
- Date
- Payment
- cogs
- gross income

- ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps in EDA included:
- Handling missing values
- Converting date columns
- Analyzing sales trends and patterns

## Visualizations
Key visualizations include:
